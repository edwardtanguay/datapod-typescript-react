# datapod-typescript-react

This is a simple datapod template for a local site that displays data from a JSON file, which is created by a TypeScript CLI script that parses a text file.

## Compatibility

-   ✔️ tested on Windows
-   ✔️ tested on Ubuntu

## Run examples

-   `npm run ex 010` (this will run dev/examples/ex010-hello-world.ts)
-   `npm run ex 020` (this will run dev/examples/ex020-any-vs-unknown.ts)

-   note that each example is wrapped in an IIFE so that the variables are not in the global space, and hence don't conflict with each other
